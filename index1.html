Technologies that facilitate access create decentralized and interoperable digital communities. Exploring its characteristics, the metaverse has characteristics such as boundlessness, persistence, decentralization, immersive virtual reality, virtual economy, and social interaction. The aim is to seamlessly transform real-world experiences into virtual, mixed and augmented realities, promoting a comprehensive understanding of their capabilities.It is also believed to be the next iteration of the internet.</p>

Graphics and visuals continue to improve to make it seem like users are in a real-life environment. With the help of metaverse, education systems can see serveral applications in areas of study such as anatomy, biology, geography and chemistry. It also helps students learn more effectively by focusing their attention on the topic they are studying.

<h3>Experience with the selected topic </h3>
<p>We are able to understand more about the metaverse through this CS1102 group project. Although metaverse has already become a household word since 2021. However, this is our first time to deeply investigate it. And while designing the hands-on workshop to younger students, we have to consider about our workshop attractiveness, what activity best suits the younger students and what, the messages we want to bring out through the workshop and can the feasibility of the workshop.</p>
